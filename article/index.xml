It should keep you busy for the next few&amp;hellip; years. And even then this only covers &lt;em&gt;the basics&lt;/em&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to do more research on concurrency, signals, testing and some other topics in security.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Five Interesting Injection Attacks</title><link>https://www.client9.com/article/five-interesting-injection-attacks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/article/five-interesting-injection-attacks/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone is familiar with SQLi and XSS.

As a consumer, user

capital-backed, open source software product (OSSP) companies to help
understand what their motivations are and where they might be going.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using Subresource Integrity to Secure Externally Hosted Content</title><link>https://www.client9.com/article/using-subresource-integrity-to-secure-externally-hosted-content/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/article/using-subresource-integrity-to-secure-externally-hosted-content/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;One simple trick that can prevent you from distributing malware or aiding a DDoS attack from your CDN.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Docker and Alpine Linux (and systemd)</title><link>https://www.client9.com/article/docker-and-alpine-linux-and-systemd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/article/docker-and-alpine-linux-and-systemd/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11000827&#34;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; by the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/company/management&#34;&gt;CTO of Docker&lt;/a&gt; on January
31, 2016 implied that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; was shifting
the default base images from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ubuntu.com&#34;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; to

complexity, how big the attack surface is and how frequently it will
need updates. Less is definitely &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. In 2015, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.client9.com/article/comparison-of-linux-distributions-on-aws-ec2/&#34;&gt;compared the
number of packages on default install on AWS
EC2&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s
see how things changed or not. This time, in addition to the number
of packages installed, I also checked on-disk image size. Corrections
and additions welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Golang and Gracefully Handling Lists in Configuration Files</title><link>https://www.client9.com/article/golang-and-gracefully-handling-lists-in-configuration-files/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2016 16:01:07 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/article/golang-and-gracefully-handling-lists-in-configuration-files/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Most configuration files are processed using &amp;lsquo;object unmarshaling&amp;rsquo; (or
deserialization) into internal data structures. While this is easy
and fast, it&amp;rsquo;s not very flexible for &lt;em&gt;configuration&lt;/em&gt;. In most cases
a &amp;ldquo;single value&amp;rdquo; and an element with a single value are treated
differently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Linux Distributions on AWS EC2</title><link>https://www.client9.com/article/comparison-of-linux-distributions-on-aws-ec2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/article/comparison-of-linux-distributions-on-aws-ec2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;How do various Linux distributions implement a operating system for
use in virtualized or cloud environments? One proxy for
size and complexity is the number of packages installed. While not a perfect
comparison, in general, less is more. In Amazon&amp;rsquo;s US-WEST-1 region, I fired up
the a number of Linux distributions and counted the number of packages
installed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DevOps The Internal User Growth Team</title><link>https://www.client9.com/article/devops-the-internal-user-growth-team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/article/devops-the-internal-user-growth-team/</guid><description>PuppetLabs invited me to guest-write for their blog. I thought about the future of DevOps and what it means after you get done automating basic infrastructure. The end result is DevOps: The Internal User Growth Team, which was the last blog post of year.

In 2010, Facebook purchased Friendster&amp;rsquo;s patents (for $40m!) and as part of the review process looked at extending or enhancing the original applications. The result of this is US Patent 8,219,500 which Chris Lunt @chrislunt and myself are listed as inventors.
