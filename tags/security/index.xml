The goal was to assess the public policy of governments stockpiling or releasing so-called 0-day exploits. While that remains an open question, the report and underlying data set of real-world exploits provides valuable insights into software engineering for security and resilience. This talk will provide an overview of the report and what it means for builders and defenders.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Software Engineering</title><link>https://www.client9.com/resilient-software-engineering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/resilient-software-engineering/</guid><description>As the velocity of application development has increased, so has the velocity (and success) of attackers. Given a massive hiring shortage of security professionals, how can we keep up and even get ahead? We can, if we change the role of security to one that is building systems that are resilient to security shocks. When we do this, we find the topics in security are quite different from what they used to be: How are we managing our software supply chain?</description></item><item><title>BYOD Bring Your Own Dependencies</title><link>https://www.client9.com/byod-bring-your-own-dependencies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/byod-bring-your-own-dependencies/</guid><description>First presented at DevOpsDays Austin, Texas on May 15, 2015.
Most memorable about this talk was a well know audience member decided I was attacking docker and made it clear to the entire convention that he was not happy with me. Afterwards, a number of people came up to me and said “so this is what devops is all about? Does this normally happen? That was really rough.” You can decide if the presentation is unfair to docker.</description></item><item><title>Secure Application Development with Golang</title><link>https://www.client9.com/secure-application-development-with-golang/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/secure-application-development-with-golang/</guid><description>First presented at RSA USA 2015, Session ASD-F02 on April 24, 2015 in San Francisco, California.
This might be the worst slide template I have ever used:
Fonts are too small Fonts are microsoft-specific Font color is grey Background is grey Background has pattern It would seem it’s specifically designed for not-reading. But if you can read it, the deck is still accurate in 2018.</description></item><item><title>libinjection: From SQLI to XSS v2</title><link>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-from-sqli-to-xss-v2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-from-sqli-to-xss-v2/</guid><description>“libinjection: From SQLI to XSS” (version 2) was first presented at Code Blue, Tokyo Japan on 2014-02-18, in English and 日本語.</description></item><item><title>libinjection: From SQLI to XSS v1</title><link>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-from-sqli-to-xss-v1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-from-sqli-to-xss-v1/</guid><description>“libinjection: From SQLI to XSS” (version 1) was first presented at OWASP AppSec SoCal, in Santa Monica, California.</description></item><item><title>Faster Secure Software Development with Continuous Deployment</title><link>https://www.client9.com/faster-secure-software-development-with-continuous-deployment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/faster-secure-software-development-with-continuous-deployment/</guid><description>First presented at PHDays on May 24, 2013 in Moscow, Russia.
Why don&amp;#39;t developers care about security issues? Why isn&amp;#39;t security training effective? Why do basic application security problems continue to exist? One reason is that long release cycles disenfranchise developers from caring or even knowing about security or operational issues. Continuous Deployment helps address this by small, but frequent, changes to the production environment. At first, this would seem less stable and less secure, however continuous deployment is a lot more than &amp;#34;pushing code&amp;#34;.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Security by Fixing Development using Continuous Deployment</title><link>https://www.client9.com/fixing-security-by-fixing-development-using-continuous-deployment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/fixing-security-by-fixing-development-using-continuous-deployment/</guid><description>First presented at Security Development Conference on May 14, 2013 in San Francisco, USA.
Do you have an effective release cycle? Is your process long and archaic? Long release cycle are typically based on assumptions we haven&amp;#39;t seen since the 1980s and require very mature organizations to implement successfully. They can also disenfranchise developers from caring or even knowing about security or operational issues. Attend this session to learn more about an alternative approach to managing deployments through Continuous Deployment, otherwise known as Continuous Delivery.</description></item><item><title>SQL-RISC New Directions in SQLi Prevention</title><link>https://www.client9.com/sql-risc-new-directions-in-sqli-prevention/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/sql-risc-new-directions-in-sqli-prevention/</guid><description>First presented at RSA USA 2013 on February 27, 2013 in San Francisco, California.</description></item><item><title>Rebooting (secure) (web) software development with Continuous Deployment</title><link>https://www.client9.com/rebooting-secure-web-software-development-with-continuous-deployment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/rebooting-secure-web-software-development-with-continuous-deployment/</guid><description>First presented at OWASP AppSec USA on October 25, 2012 in Austin, Texas.
Original Abstract:
If we are ever going to get ahead of the whack-a-mole security vulnerability game, we, as security professionals need to start getting involved more in the development of software. Let&amp;#39;s review the origins of the traditional software development, and what assumptions are made. Then we&amp;#39;ll review if those assumptions still hold for modern web applications, and what problems they cause, especially for security.</description></item><item><title>libinjection and SQLi Obfuscation</title><link>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-and-sqli-obfuscation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-and-sqli-obfuscation/</guid><description>First presented at OWASP NYC on September 20, 2012 at DTCC&amp;#39;s headquarters on 55 Water Street, New York City.</description></item><item><title>libinjection: New Techniques in Detecting SQLi Attacks</title><link>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-new-techniques-in-detecting-sqli-attacks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-new-techniques-in-detecting-sqli-attacks/</guid><description>First presented at iSEC Partners Open Forum on September 6, 2012 at Gilt Group, New York City.</description></item><item><title>PHP Static Analysis 2012</title><link>https://www.client9.com/php-static-analysis-2012/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/php-static-analysis-2012/</guid><description>Over at the Code as Craft blog by Etsy on how static analysis for PHP was done. Here’s the intro:
At Etsy we have three tiers of static analysis on our PHP code that run on every commit or runs periodically every hour. They form an important part of our continuous deployment pipeline along with one-button deploys, fast unit and functional tests, copious amounts of graphing, and a fantastic development environment to make sure code flows safely and securely to production.</description></item><item><title>New Techniques in SQLi Obfuscation</title><link>https://www.client9.com/new-techniques-in-sqli-obfuscation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/new-techniques-in-sqli-obfuscation/</guid><description>First presented Friday July 27, 2012 at DEFCON 20, Las Vegas, NV, at the RIO on 4:20pm.
Original abstract:
SQLi remains a popular sport in the security arms-race. However, after analysis of hundreds of thousands of real world SQLi attacks, output from SQLi scanners, published reports, analysis of WAF source code, and database vendor documentation, both SQLi attackers and defenders have missed a few opportunities. This talk will iterate through the dark corners of SQL for use in new obfuscated attacks, and show why they are problematic for regular-expression based WAFs.</description></item><item><title>libinjection: a C library for SQLi detection</title><link>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-a-c-library-for-sqli-detection/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/libinjection-a-c-library-for-sqli-detection/</guid><description>First presented Wednesday July 25, 2012 at Black Hat USA, Las Vegas, NV. Augustus I/II at 2:45pm.
From the original abstract:
SQLi and other injection attacks remain the top OWASP and CERT vulnerability. Current detection attempts frequently involve a myriad of regular expressions which are not only brittle and error prone but also proven by Hanson and Patterson at Black Hat 2005 to never be a complete solution. libinjection is a new open source C library that detects SQLi using lexical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Better Random Numbers in PHP using /dev/urandom</title><link>https://www.client9.com/better-random-numbers-in-php-using-dev-urandom/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/better-random-numbers-in-php-using-dev-urandom/</guid><description>First posted in the Code as Craft blog. Here’s the intro:
The design of PHP’s basic random number generators rand and it’s newer variant mt_rand is based off the C Standard Library. For better or worse, both use a single global state and this can be reset using stand (or mt_srand). This means anyone (a developer, a third party module, a library) could set the state to a fixed value and every random number following will be the same for every request.</description></item><item><title>Robots, Graphs and Binary Search</title><link>https://www.client9.com/robots-graphs-and-binary-search/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/robots-graphs-and-binary-search/</guid><description>Over at the Code as Craft blog by Etsy is a new article on detecting and monitoring robotic traffic and the use of a IP categorization database.

Rate limiting is a useful technique to limit malicious and undesirable behavior on web services. This talk will present a simple rate limit implementation using memcached that allows one to easily add rate limiting anywhere in their application. We’ll then cover some (surprising) real-world uses of rate limits, how to distinguish between enthusiasm and maliciousness, and finally some of the common countermeasures that are used.</description></item><item><title>Google Safe Browsing without the Browser</title><link>https://www.client9.com/google-safe-browsing-without-the-browser/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.client9.com/google-safe-browsing-without-the-browser/</guid><description>Over at Etsy&amp;#39;s Code as Craft blog is a new article on using the Google Safe Browsing API to analyze user generated content for malware links on the server.
